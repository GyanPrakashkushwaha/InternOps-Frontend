4. Work with LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, open-source models)
5. Assist in intent detection, entity extraction, and sentiment handling
6. Help implement conversation memory and context management
7. Test agent responses and improve conversation quality

B. Backend & Integration Support (~20%)
1. Assist in integrating agents with backend APIs
2. Work with social media APIs and webhooks
3. Help implement lead capture, FAQs, and routing logic
